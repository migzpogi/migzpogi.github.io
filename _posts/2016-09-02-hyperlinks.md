Tim Berners-Lee, the main inventor of the web, is believed to be the man who first made hyperlinks blue. Mosaic, a very early web browser, displayed webpages with a gray background and black text. The darkest color available at the time that was easily distinguishable from the black text was that blue color. Therefore, to make links stand apart from plain text, but still be readable, the color blue was selected.
