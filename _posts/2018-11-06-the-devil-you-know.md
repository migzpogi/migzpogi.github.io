# The Devil You Know
**This contains spoilers from the Marvel TV show Daredevil**

I'm halfway through the third season of Daredevil and Matt finally meets Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter, also known as Bullseye. Fun fact: poindexter is an actual word which means *"a boringly studious and socially inept person"*. #TIL

Captain America: The Winter Soldier holds a very special place in my heart. It is my favorite Marvel movie simply because it has the best fight sequence among all the MCU has to offer.
