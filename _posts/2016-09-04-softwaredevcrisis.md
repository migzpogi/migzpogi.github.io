Some of my favorite points from the article:

### Be Wary Of High Performers
Odds are far better than good that your high performers are achieving what appears to be high levels of productivity by **building technical debt** into the application by taking shortcuts whether intentionally or unintentionally. 

### Watch Out For Misleading Metrics
Software developers aren’t stupid and some of them will quickly **learn how to game the system** if counterproductive incentives are visible. Completed work item counts are an extremely counterproductive incentive and the game quickly becomes all about having the highest completed work item count.

### Never Turn Down Small Requests
When compared to their salary and benefits **these little requests go a long way** toward keeping morale and thus productivity high and they cost peanuts. If you don’t have the budget for these kinds of small requests it’s time to start looking for work at another company because mid- and upper-level management is broken.

### You're Not Better Than Your Employees
Software development is a job. Software development management is a job. **Just because your employees report to you doesn’t imply you’re somehow smarter or better.** A lot of software developers — dare I say most software developers — just plain love being software developers. Don’t you confuse and don’t let your software developers confuse management as career progression — it’s just a different job even if it generally pays a bit more.

### Don't Have Stupid Dress Codes
By now humanity has learned that over-the-top **dress codes don’t improve productivity or company success.** And certainly the only men left wearing neckties should be bankers or lawyers. Okay, I’m kidding about that last part — a little. Let your employees be comfortable. For some of them that’s jeans and a basic collared shirt and for others it’s business casual. They’re adults and you should let them decide.
