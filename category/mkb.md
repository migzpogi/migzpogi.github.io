# What is a Rubber Dome Keyboard?
It is important for us to discuss first what a rubber dome (also known as membrane) keyboards is. A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose "keys" are not separate, moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface. Very little, if any, tactile feedback is felt when using such a keyboard, and error-free blind typing is difficult. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard)

# What is a Mechanical Keyboard?
A mechanical keyboard uses actual, physical switches underneath the keys to determine when the user has pushed a key. Press a key, and you press its switch down. Press the switch down, and the keyboard sends a signal to the PC telling it that you pressed that key. The one and only job of a single switch is to tell whether or not that key was actuated.
