See if you can find the truth in what they 
believe.</li><li>Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, 
until there is no more.</li><li>Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them 
an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.</li><li>The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.</li><li>How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.</li><li>When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have 
empathy toward them which can soften the conflict.</li><li>Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again 
later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.</li><li>Talk to people more.  Read more long content and less tweets.  Watch less TV.  Spend less time on the Internet.</li><li>Go out of your way to help people.  Few things in life are as satisfying.  Be nice to strangers.  Be nice even when it doesn’t matter.</li><li>Forgive people. </li><li>It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.</li><li>You don’t marry a person, you marry a family.</li><li>Don’t screw people and don’t burn bridges.  Pick your battles carefully.</li></ul><h2 id="on-improving" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>On Improving</h2><ul><li>Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it 
perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.</li><li>The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to 
do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.</li><li>Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze 
at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t 
inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same 
question and is too embarrassed to ask it.</li><li>Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.</li></ul><h2 id="values" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Values</h2><ul><li>Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.</li><li>Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make 
new friends.</li><li>Promptness is a sign of respect.</li><li>Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.</li><li>If you borrow something, try to return it in better shape than you received it. Clean it, sharpen it, fill it up.</li></ul><h2 id="household" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Household</h2><ul><li>Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.</li><li>Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.</li><li>If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back 
where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.</li><li>Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up 
using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.</li><li>If you are looking for your "good" X then you have a "bad" X. Throw those out.</li><li>Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are established, junk will probably
cease to be a problem.</li></ul><h2 id="career" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Career</h2><ul><li>The best way I've advanced my career is by changing companies.</li><li>Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.</li><li>Being a good engineer means knowing best practices.
