father’s legacy—is perfectionism. You always try to be perfect, he says, and you always fall short, and it fucks with 
your head. Your confidence is shot, and perfectionism is the reason. You try to hit a winner on every ball, when just 
being steady, consistent, meat and potatoes, would be enough to win ninety percent of the time. <strong>You don’t have to be 
the best in the world every time you go out there. You just have to be better than one guy.</strong> When I’m playing blackjack, 
I’d rather win with sixteen, because that’s winning ugly. No need to win with twenty-one. No need to be perfect.</p><h2 id="language-of-life" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Language Of Life</h2><p>It’s no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic 
elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of 
tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days.</p><h2 id="being-the-best-at-what-you-do" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Being The Best At What You Do</h2><p>I’m calmed, grounded, inspired by watching a craftsman. It reminds me of the singular importance in this world of a job 
done well.</p><p>Though I hate tennis, I like the feeling of hitting a ball dead perfect. It’s the only peace. When I do something 
perfect, I enjoy a split second of sanity and calm.</p><h2 id="importance-of-rest" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Importance Of Rest</h2><p>Moments before we take the court I wonder why a player as polished and accomplished as Mac needs a hiatus. Then he shows 
me. He demonstrates the virtue of rest. He beats me soundly, 6–3, 6–3.</p><h2 id="clay" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Clay</h2><p>The sudden switch from one surface to another changes everything. Clay is a different game, thus your game must become 
different, and so must your body. Instead of sprinting from side to side, stopping short and starting, you must slide 
and lean and dance. Familiar muscles now play supporting roles, dormant muscles dominate. It’s painful enough, under the 
best of circumstances, that I don’t know who I am. To suddenly become a different person, a clay person, adds another 
degree of frustration and anxiety.</p><h2 id="proper-training" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Proper Training</h2><p>I don’t want to step on anybody’s toes, he says. I don’t want to speak out of turn. But I can’t lie to you: if somebody 
can write down your routine on a piece of paper, it isn’t worth the piece of paper it’s written on. You’re asking me to 
put you through a workout here that leaves no room for where you are, how you’re feeling, what you need to focus on. 
It doesn’t allow for change.</p><h2 id="winning" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Winning</h2><p>Losing is one thing; being outgunned is another.</p><p>But I don’t feel that Wimbledon has changed me. I feel, in fact, as if I’ve been let in on a dirty little secret: 
winning changes nothing. Now that I’ve won a slam, I know something that very few people on earth are permitted to know. 
A win doesn’t feel as good as a loss feels bad, and the good feeling doesn’t last as long as the bad. Not even close.</p><p>All that work and anger and winning and training and hoping and sweating, and it leads to the same empty disappointed 
feeling. No matter how much you win, if you’re not the last one to win, you’re a loser. And in the end I always lose, 
because there is always Pete. As always, Pete.</p><p>Even though I feel Tarango cheated me, I shouldn’t have put him in a position to cheat me. I shouldn’t have let the 
match get that close.</p><p>That’s the finish line I’ve been seeking, the finish line with the inexorable pull. Can’t play, as opposed to won’t play. 
Unwittingly, I’ve been seeking that moment when I’d have no choice.</p><h2 id="education" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Education</h2><p>The look on his face is a complete shock. I didn’t understand the meaning and value of education, the hardship and 
stress it causes most parents and children. I’ve never thought of education like that. School was always a place I 
managed to escape, not a thing to be treasured. Setting aside the stock was merely something I did because Frankie 
specifically mentioned college and I wanted to help. When I saw what it meant to him, however, I was the one who got 
educated.</p><h2 id="helping-others" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Helping Others</h2><p>Helping Frankie provides more satisfaction and makes me feel more connected and alive and myself than anything else that 
happens in 1996. I tell myself: Remember this. Hold on to this. This is the only perfection there is, the perfection of 
helping others. This is the only thing we can do that has any lasting value or meaning. This is why we’re here. To make 
each other feel safe</p><p>This is why we’re here. To fight through the pain and, when possible, to relieve the pain of others. So simple. So hard 
to see.</p><h2 id="pete-sampras" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Pete Sampras</h2><p>Brad and I were eating at an Italian restaurant, Mama Gina’s, and we saw Pete eating with friends on the other side of 
the dining room. He stopped by and said hello on his way out. Good luck tomorrow. You too. Then we watched him through 
the restaurant window, waiting for his car. We said nothing, each of us thinking of the difference he’d made in our 
lives. As Pete drove away I asked Brad how much he thought Pete tipped the valet. Brad hooted. Five bucks, tops. No way, 
I said. The guy’s got millions. He’s earned forty mil in prize money alone. He’s got to be good for at least a ten spot. 
Bet? Bet. We ate fast and rushed outside. Listen, I told the valet, give us the absolute truth: How much did Mr. Sampras 
tip you? The kid looked at his feet. He didn’t want to tell. He was weighing, wondering if he was on a hidden-camera 
show. We told the kid we had a bet riding on this, so we absolutely were insisting he tell us. Finally he whispered: 
You really want to know? Shoot. He gave me a dollar. Brad put a hand on his heart. But that’s not all, the kid said. 
He gave me a dollar—and he told me to be sure to give it to whichever kid actually brought his car around. We could not 
be more different, Pete and I, and as I fall asleep the night before perhaps our final final, I vow that the world will 
see our differences tomorrow.</p><p>Now he’s serving for the match, and when Pete serves for a match, he’s a coldblooded killer. Everything happens very 
fast. Ace. Blur. Backhand volley, no way to reach it. Applause. Handshake at the net. Pete gives me a friendly smile, a 
pat on the back, but the expression on his face is unmistakable. I’ve seen it before. Here’s a buck, kid. 
Bring my car around.</p><script id="dhjdFSkBmO">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("dhjdFSkBmO", "rO4PjVi70GuVKXXpNrRVhw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-7" data-no-search=""><a href="#open" class="h1" data-content-highlight="open">Open</a><a href="#control-the-things-you-can" class="h2" data-content-highlight="control-the-things-you-can">Control The Things You Can</a><a href="#disorder-is-distraction" class="h2" data-content-highlight="disorder-is-distraction">Disorder Is Distraction</a><a href="#pressure" class="h2" data-content-highlight="pressure">Pressure</a><a href="#perfectionism" class="h2" data-content-highlight="perfectionism">Perfectionism</a><a href="#language-of-life" class="h2" data-content-highlight="language-of-life">Language Of Life</a><a href="#being-the-best-at-what-you-do" class="h2" data-content-highlight="being-the-best-at-what-you-do">Being The Best At What You Do</a><a href="#importance-of-rest" class="h2" data-content-highlight="importance-of-rest">Importance Of Rest</a><a href="#clay" class="h2" data-content-highlight="clay">Clay</a><a href="#proper-training" class="h2" data-content-highlight="proper-training">Proper Training</a><a href="#winning" class="h2" data-content-highlight="winning">Winning</a><a href="#education" class="h2" data-content-highlight="education">Education</a><a href="#helping-others" class="h2" data-content-highlight="helping-others">Helping Others</a><a href="#pete-sampras" class="h2" data-content-highlight="pete-sampras">Pete Sampras</a></div></div> <div class="footer-0-0-6"><div class="left"><script id="MURfMPEaAI">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("MURfMPEaAI", "+KieMbbjofCG8mi4EMUxhw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script></div><div class="main"><div class="inside"><a href="/index">Home</a><hr><a href="/posts">Posts</a><hr><a href="https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc/">Codedoc</a></div></div><div class="right"><script id="fMGEQIUjlQ">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("fMGEQIUjlQ", "NqBTEGb5LCZ9A/R386IgBw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script></div></div><script id="ecmelc_BDb">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("ecmelc_BDb", "0fzUui8WISeUIekbH6XOXw==", {"namespace":""});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script></body></html>
