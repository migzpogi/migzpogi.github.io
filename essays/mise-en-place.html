Does it really matter whether you send that email or write up that report first? But once we realize the importance of sequence, it becomes apparent that not all moments are created equal: the first tasks matter much more than the later ones.</li><li>In a kitchen, the few seconds it takes to start heating up a pan or start defrosting the chicken will have the biggest impact on the overall timeline, because these steps can’t be accelerated. They take as much time as they take. Likewise, in knowledge work, the first tasks matter the most. The first acts of your morning will set the direction of your entire day. The first thing you do when starting your workday will set the tone for everything that follows. </li></ul></li><li>Placeholders<ul><li>Every time we capture an “open loop” - a new email, or a spontaneous thought in our mind - we are placing artifacts in our environment to serve as reminders. And that should trigger an immediate "first move" such as adding an appointment to the calendar or creating a digital note. Each of these items serves as a reminder of an action you might want to take, and they are all preserved in a trusted place outside your head.</li></ul></li><li>Immersive vs. Process Time<ul><li>Immersive time requires focus and involvement like stirring, mincind, and seasoning. Processing time includes grilling, heating, and marinating. Things you can do while you have your attention elsewhere. </li><li>We tend to overvalue immersive time (deep work) because it feels like we are doing our best, most important work. But it is actually process time that offers us the most leverage. Because the small actions we take to kick off process time unlock the efforts of others on our behalf.</li></ul></li><li>Finishing Mindset<ul><li>In cooking, a dish that is 99% finished has zero value. The same situation applies to knowledge work. It seems harmless to start and stop tasks as new information becomes available. But there is a hidden cost each time we do so. The unfinished task has to be managed and tracked and updated. It takes up space in our subconscious mind.</li></ul></li><li>Small, precise movements<ul><li>Small moves doesn't take much time. Precise moves has exactly its intended effect. They can be repeated quickly, which helps the body memorize the muscle movements and turn many of them into automatic habits. They can be standardized and measured, which leads to further gains in efficiency.</li></ul></li><li>Arrangement<ul><li>It’s up to us to curate, design, and arrange our virtual workspaces to provide the predictability that our work inherently lacks. The boundaries tell you what you should be focusing on, and just as importantly, what you should ignore.</li></ul></li></ol><div style="text-align: right"><a class="button-0-0-3" href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/mise-en-place-for-knowledge-workers/" target="_blank">Source</a></div><script id="XeZFgLkSBv">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("XeZFgLkSBv", "u57FALME0msFjeOPW2+9hg==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-7" data-no-search=""><a href="#mise-en-place-for-knowledge-workers" class="h1" data-content-highlight="mise-en-place-for-knowledge-workers">Mise-en-place for Knowledge Workers</a></div></div> <div class="footer-0-0-6"><div class="left"><script id="nXmSGCFF_a">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("nXmSGCFF_a", "2KQ/U4adi/Z/oAWMjb12/g==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script></div><div class="main"><div class="inside"><a href="/index">Home</a><hr><a href="/posts">Posts</a><hr><a href="https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc/">Codedoc</a></div></div><div class="right"><script id="EYgTmOhMyp">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("EYgTmOhMyp", "jR4pIl18XyJlqy0MRQ030Q==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script></div></div><script id="hzsrmvjJmJ">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("hzsrmvjJmJ", "aa09u7XPvNn0PoGLSC9eYA==", {"namespace":""});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script></body></html>
