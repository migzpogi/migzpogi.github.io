# Awesome Stuff
A curated list of things I find awesome. Inspired by the [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

## [theaters](:Icon) Videos
* [No Quit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIzBsvHwYr4) - My favorite Nike ad.
* [UAAP 81 UP vs AdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTcM0X4SY4w) - Nov. 28, 2018 UP advances to the finals.
* [Madmen - Layers of Meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ1Rbdi189w) - I honestly thought this show was about
gangsters.
* [8:46 - Dave Chappelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4) - Why isn't Dave Chappelle saying anything? 
Because Dave Chappelle understands what the fuck he is seeing. And these streets will speak for themselves whether I am 
alive or dead.

### Kurzgesagt
In a nutshell.
* [An Antidote to Dissatisfaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0) - Gratitude: while it may sound like 
another self-improvement trend, preached by people who use hashtags, what we currently know about it is based on a 
body of scientific work and studies.
* [Optimistic Nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14) - If this is our one shot at life, there is no 
reason to have fun and live as happy as possible.
* [The Past We Can Never Return To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgnlkJPga4) - These communities hunted and gathered 
and there were no large caloric surpluses. So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of 
food and water, and yet somehow they still made time to create art. Almost as if art isn't optional.
