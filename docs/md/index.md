# Hello!
* [laptop_mac](:Icon) Python dev
* [cloud](:Icon) Azure DevOps
* [keyboard](:Icon) Mechanical keyboards  

I am currently working on a personal project called [leonhard](https://pypi.org/project/leonhard/), a commons library 
for Project Euler problems. It uses Azure DevOps for its CI/CD pipeline. My favorite mechanical keyboard switch is
Cherry MX Blues.
