# Gear Score Web API
This is a web API for the gear score component of World of Warcraft: Wrath of The Lich King

## Inspiration
Snuske is a Discord bot that shows gear summary (including gear score) of players in Warmane. The author made a database
containing the list of WoW 3.3.5a items as well as their gear score. This web API extends this functionality. His github
profile can be reached [here](https://github.com/mortenmoulder/Snuske).
