# Problem 2  - Even Fibonacci numbers

## Question
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the 
first 10 terms will be:  

* 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
even-valued terms.

## Solution
```python | euler_002.py
def generate_fibonacci_sequence(term_limit, first_term, second_term):
    sequence = [first_term, second_term]
    while True:
        next_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
        if next_number < term_limit:
            sequence.append(next_number)
        else:
            break
            
    return sequence

four_million_sequence = generate_fibonacci_sequence(4000000, 1, 2)
print(sum([n for n in four_million_sequence if n % 2 == 0])) # // @see [List Comprehension](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-comprehension)
```

## Discussion
* Let us first start by creating a function that [generates a Fibonacci sequence](#code1-l1). This accepts three 
parameters:
  * `term_limit`: the maximum number in the sequence
  * `first_term`: the first number in the sequence
  * `second_term`: the second number in the sequence
* The [first and second terms](#code1-l2) are put into a list `sequence` 
* We go in this [loop](#code1-l3:l8) until `next_number` reaches the `term_limit`.
  * The next number in the sequence is calculated by [adding the last two numbers](#code1-l4) in the sequence, which is 
  `sequence[-1]` and `sequence[-2]` respectively.
  * [Check](#code1-l5) if `next_number` is less than the `term_limit`. 
    * If it is, then [append](#code1-l6) it to `sequence`.
    * If it is **not**, then [stop](#code1-l8) the loop.
* Running this function will show: 
```python
print(generate_fibonacci_sequence(10, 0, 1))
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
* Another example:
```python
print(generate_fibonacci_sequence(90, 1, 2))
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```
* [Generate a Fibonacci sequence](#code1-l12) whose values do not exceed four million and that it starts with 1 and 2.
* [We get the sum](#code1-l13) of all even numbers in the sequence by using list comprehension.
