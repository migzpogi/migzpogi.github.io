# Problem 30 - Digit fifth powers

## Question
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
* 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
* 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
* 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4

As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

## Solution
```python | euler_030.py
def digits_to_power(number, power):
    total = 0
    for n in str(number):
        total += int(n)**power

    if number == total:
        return number
    else:
        return 0

total = 0
for i in range(2, 295245):  # limit is computed as 5 * 9**5
    total += digits_to_power(i, 5)

print(total)
```

## Discussion
* We first create a function that [gets the sum of the power of their digits](#code1-l1:l9). For simplicity's sake, we
just return the same number if it is true, else, we return 0.
* The real challenge of this problem is knowing the upper limit. Apparently, there is a formula to get it: 
[5\cdot 9^{5}](:Formula).
* We run a for loop of all the numbers between 2 and 295245 (because 1 is excluded as stated in the problem) and checking 
if they are equal to sum of the 5th power of their digits.
