# Problem 71  - Ordered fractions

## Question
Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction. If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:
* 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8  

It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.


## Solution
```python | euler_071.py
from fractions import Fraction

```

## Discussion
* We first create functions that [tests if a number is triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal](#code1-l3:l23). 
Similar to Euler problem 42, these formula can be derived. 
* This [function](#code1-l24) will generate the nth triangle number.

* We will [skip](#code1-l28) 1 and 40755 (because we want to find the NEXT triangle number that is also pentagonal and 
hexagonal)
* This will [create an iterator](#code1-l29) that contains consecutive numbers starting from zero.
* Then we [generate a triangle](#code1-l30) number from that.
* If the generated triangle number is not 1 nor 40755, and is also pentagonal, and hexagonal, the loop breaks. [That is
our answer.](#code1-l31:l33)
