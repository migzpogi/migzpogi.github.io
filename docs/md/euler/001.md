# Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5

## Question
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution
```python | euler_001.py
total = 0
for num in range(1, 1000):
    if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
        total += num

print(total)

# --> Alternate answer that uses list comprehension
print(sum([num for num in range(1, 1000) if (num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0)])) # // @see [List Comprehension](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-comprehension)
```

## Discussion
* We use the [range function](#code1-l2) to generate numbers 1 to 999 since the problem wants us to find the sum of all 
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. 
* To check if a number is a multiple of 3 or 5, we will use the [modulo operator](#code1-l3). The modulo operator retrieves the remainder
after a division. A number is a multiple of another number if their remainder is 0. 
* [This](#code1-l4) is short hand for `total = total + num`
