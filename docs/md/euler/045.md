# Problem 45  - Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

## Question
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:
* Triangle - Tn=n(n+1)/2 - 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
* Pentagonal - Pn=n(3n−1)/2 - 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
* Hexagonal - Hn=n(2n−1) - 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

## Solution
```python | euler_045.py
import itertools

def is_triangular(n):
    if (((8*n) + 1) ** 0.5) % 1 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False


def is_pentagonal(n):
    if (((((24 * n) + 1) ** 0.5) + 1) / 6) % 1 == 0 :
        return True
    else:
        return False


def is_hexagonal(n):
    if (((((8 * n) + 1) ** 0.5) + 1) / 4) % 1 == 0 :
        return True
    else:
        return 


def generate_triangle_number(n):
    return (n+1) * n * 0.5


skip = [1, 40755]
for i in itertools.count():
    triangle = generate_triangle_number(i)
    if triangle not in skip and is_pentagonal(triangle) and is_hexagonal(triangle):
        print(triangle)
        break
```

## Discussion
* We first create functions that [tests if a number is triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal](#code1-l3:l23). 
Similar to Euler problem 42, these formula can be derived. 
* This [function](#code1-l24) will generate the nth triangle number.

* We will [skip](#code1-l28) 1 and 40755 (because we want to find the NEXT triangle number that is also pentagonal and 
hexagonal)
* This will [create an iterator](#code1-l29) that contains consecutive numbers starting from zero.
* Then we [generate a triangle](#code1-l30) number from that.
* If the generated triangle number is not 1 nor 40755, and is also pentagonal, and hexagonal, the loop breaks. [That is
our answer.](#code1-l31:l33)
