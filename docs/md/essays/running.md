# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running
Notes on Haruki Murakami's book which can also be applied not only to running but to our daily lives.

## Rhythm
To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for long-term projects. Once you set the 
pace, the rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed—and to get to that point takes as 
much concentration and effort as you can manage.

## Improvement
I’m no great runner, by any means. I’m at an ordinary—or perhaps more like mediocre—level. But that’s not the point. 
The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday.

## Training
There are three reasons I failed. Not enough training. Not enough training. And not enough training. I’d developed a 
sort of arrogant attitude, convinced that just a fair-to-middling amount of training was enough for me to do a good job. 
It’s pretty thin, the wall separating healthy confidence and unhealthy pride.

## Excuses
If I used being busy as an excuse not to run, I’d never run again. I have only a few reasons to keep on running, and a 
truckload of them to quit. All I can do is keep those few reasons nicely polished.

## Significance
But as I drew near the end of this ultramarathon, I wasn’t really thinking about this. The end of the race is just a 
temporary marker without much significance. It’s the same with our lives. Just because there’s an end doesn’t mean 
existence has meaning. An end point is simply set up as a temporary marker, or perhaps as an indirect metaphor for the 
fleeting nature of existence. It’s very philosophical—not that at this point I’m thinking how philosophical it is. I 
just vaguely experience this idea, not with words, but as a physical sensation.

## Learning
In most cases learning something essential in life requires physical pain. Since that incident on the bike, no matter 
how tired I might be I always keep my head up and my eyes on the road ahead.

## Want
What I mean is, I didn’t start running because somebody asked me to become a runner. Just like I didn’t become a 
novelist because someone asked me to. One day, out of the blue, I wanted to write a novel. And one day, out of the blue, 
I started to run—simply because I wanted to. I’ve always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop 
me, and convince me I’m wrong, but I won’t change.
