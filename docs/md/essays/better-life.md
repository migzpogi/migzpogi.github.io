# Tips For A Better Life

## Possessions
* Things you use for a significant fraction of your life such as beds and chairs are worth investing in.
* If you are looking for your "good" X then you have a "bad" X. Throw those out.
* Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are established, junk will probably
cease to be a problem.

## Productivity
* Done is better than perfect.
* Discipline is superior than motivation.
* How you spend your day is how you spend your life.

## Self
* Deficiencies do not make you special.
* Things that aren't your fault can still be your responsibility.
* Compliment people more.
