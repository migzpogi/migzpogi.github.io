# How Do I Find Energy To Work On Hobbies After The Work Day Ends?

## Work On Your Hobbies Before Your Actual Work
Don't spend all of your "prime time" in your job. In the morning, when I am rested and focused, I dedicate the first one 
or two hours of the day to work on my things. Of course this pushes my schedule and I finish work later, but at the end 
it feels like an accomplished day. There's no feeling of guilt because you "only worked on your job". This of course only 
applies if you have a flexible job.

## You Cannot Do Everything At Once
I had very similar goals as you in the beginning of the year. I was trying to write posts for my blog, learn my partner's 
language, study for the Terraform associate exam, and exercise daily. All combined with a moderately demanding job. We 
simply cannot have that many things in our buffer. Try to focus on what's more urgent or important for you. Do one or 
two things at a time.
