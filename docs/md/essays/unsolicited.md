# 20 Bits of Unsolicited Advice

## Relationship With Other People
* Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they 
believe.
* Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, 
until there is no more.
* Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them 
an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
* The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
* How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.
* When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have 
empathy toward them which can soften the conflict.
* Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again 
later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.

## On Improving
* Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it 
perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
* The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to 
do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.
* Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze 
at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t 
inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.
* Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same 
question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
* Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.

## Values
* Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.
* Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make 
new friends.
* Promptness is a sign of respect.
* Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.

## Household
* Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
* Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.
* If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back 
where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.
* Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up 
using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
